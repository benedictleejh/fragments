# Fragments

Fragments is a tool for collaborative storytelling. By utilising visualisation, story contributors can track the
progression of a story, providing a way to easily see the branches of a story, helping to encourage branching.

Fragments is currently in alpha.

The prototype is currently deployed [here](http://limitless-cliffs-8166.herokuapp.com/)
