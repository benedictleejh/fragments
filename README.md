# Fragments

Fragments is a tool for collaborative storytelling. By utilising visualisation, story contributors can track the
progression of a story, providing a way to easily see the branches of a story, helping to encourage branching.

In the interest of staying provider agnostic, the master branch of the project is generic production ready code 
that can be modified to deploy on any server/PaaS.

This branch contains the necessary changes to the project to make it work on Heroku.

The prototype is currently deployed [here](http://fragments-beta.herokuapp.com/)
